Hi everyone, my name is [Carlos Santana](https://github.com/csantanapr). I've been part of the Knative community since the start.
I worked initialized on eventing architecture at the beginning and recently became more involved in user experience. I'm currently a lead for the UX working group. I do the global release notes blog posts.
I like to work with developers and help new folks get started
with knative, I help in answering questions in slack and stackoverflow
on how to best use and architect their knative applications.
I do presentations at conferences and meetups, providing enablement and demo for the community.

My motivation for running is to help with the project awareness and technical aspects in terms of API, design, and usability to make
Knative the project that bridges the developer experience in Kubernetes
to be one of the easiest ways to develop and run workloads on the Cloud using Serverless and Event-Driven Applications.
